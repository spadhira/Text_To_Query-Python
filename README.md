# Text_To_Query-Python
This project transforms natural language queries into SQL statements using the GPT-Neo 2.7B model. It simplifies database querying by allowing users to input plain text and receive valid SQL code, making data retrieval accessible to non-technical users. Built with Python and Hugging Face's Transformers, it streamlines data interaction efficiently.
